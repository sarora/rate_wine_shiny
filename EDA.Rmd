## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```





## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### ReadIn and remove columns I do not need. (Pre-decided to o)
```{r}
wine <- readr::read_csv("data/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")

```


### Remove columns I do not need 


```{r}
wine <- select(wine,-c(taster_name,taster_twitter_handle,region_2))

```


### Get dimensions

```{r}
glimpse(wine)
```






#### Find all columns which are blank

```{r}
### https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21951605/how-count-elements-in-an-column-that-are-not-empty

BlankValues <- function(X) {
sum(grepl("^\\s+$|^$",X))
}
apply(wine,2,BlankValues)

```


### Find all cells which are NA

```{r}
colSums(sapply(wine, is.na))
```


> Price have 8996 NA's. Decided to keep the NA's. User can ignore those wines if they want.


#### Replacing blank Variety cell with its value. 

```{r}

#Cabernet Sauvignon: the actual value) (https://www.wine-searcher.com/wine-17569-1999-carmen-gold-reserve-cabernet-sauvignon-maipo-valley-chile)
replace = which(is.na(wine$variety))
wine[replace, "variety"] = "Cabernet Sauvignon"
```


#### Replace all values which are NA with Not Known.

```{r}
wine[is.na(wine)] <- "Not Known"

```

#### Check for 

```{r}
colSums(sapply(wine, is.na))

```


#### Check for duplicated rows. 

```{r}
paste("The number of duplicated rows are", nrow(wine) - nrow(unique(wine)))
```

#### Save dataframe as dataset.

```{r}
write.csv(wine, file = "data/wine_fil.csv",row.names=FALSE, fileEncoding = "UTF-8")

```


```{r}
wine %>%select(country,variety) %>%  filter(country == "France") %>% group_by(variety) %>% summarise(count_v = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_v))

wine %>%select(country,variety) %>%  filter(country == "US") %>% group_by(variety) %>% summarise(count_v = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_v))

wine %>%select(country,variety) %>%  filter(country == "England") %>% group_by(variety) %>% summarise(count_v = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_v))



wine %>%select(country,variety) %>% group_by(price) %>% summarise(count_v = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_v))
